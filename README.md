# Invoice App

Invoice App is a mini project that I built using React. It stores the delivery details, payment, and shipping details. In the end, it will generate the total summary that customer should pay.

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
